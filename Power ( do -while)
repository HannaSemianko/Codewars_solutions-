//The goal is to create a function 'numberToPower(number, power)' that "raises" the number up to power (ie multiplies number by itself power times).

function numberToPower(number, power){
  let count = 0;
  let mult = 1;
    do {
      mult = mult * number;
      count++;
    } while ( count < power)
return power === 0 ? 1 : mult;
}
